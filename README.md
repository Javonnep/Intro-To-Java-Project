*The game was developed on a laptop with a smaller screen+smaller resolution then the device teh demo was recorded on so I had to use the windows magnifier application  

This was my first large code project. It turned out pretty well, with lots of features(listed below) and It was also how I first learnt about core Object Oriented Programming principles.

High Score saving
Advanced Game State saving
Audio
An interactive GUI
Projectiles
And more.

If youd like to see what it looks like I made some impromptu demo videos with most of the gameplay where I showed off most off the features
